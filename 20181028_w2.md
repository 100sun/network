# 1.3 Network Core

* connecting network edges(⊃ end hosts) 
* the mesh of interconnected routers
* when sending packets, forwarding from a router to the next router
    - routing: Get a path from source host to destination host using routing algorithms
    - forwarding: Move packets from the before router to the next router using forwarding table

## Two fundamental approaches to moving data

### comparison

| circuit switching | packet switching |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| call setup, resource reservation<br/> : the resources needed along a path | No call setup, no resource reservation |
| multiple users sharing a link<br/> by Frequency Division Multiplexing , Time Division Multiplexing | full link capacity<br/> by dividing into small packets which have their own each destination address<br/> using store-and-forward transmission |
| low speed | 3.5x users but after it.. low Quality Of Service |
| in telephone networks | ~ |

### store-and-forward transmission

* app in source Host ---link(by packets)---> app in destination Host
* how? storing bits until a packet and then forwarding it
* => [total time](##delay)

## A Network of Networks

Internet = A Network (by ISP) of Networks (end system) 

### hierarchy structure

host < access ISP < regional ISP (peering link) < Internet eXchange Point < Tier 1 ISP or Content Provider

* content provider has its own **content provider network** in its own data center

# 1.4 Evaluation Metrics in networks

## delay

: source~destination seconds

1. nodal **processing** delay: before forwarding a packet, should check its error and destination address
    - opt to the quality of router
2. **queueing** delay: when forwarding one packet, the other packet should wait in a buffer.
    - opt to the number of network users => so variable
    - **traffic intensity** = La/R ↑ ~1 infinite<br/> when packet arrival rate(packet/sec) > output link capacity(L/R) <br/> <=> over the queue -> dropped
3. **transmission** to the link delay when starting to forward: A host send a packet of ***L bits*** over a link with transmission rate ***R bits/sec***, then the time to transmit the packet is ***L/R sec***.  (link transmission rate = link capacity = link bandwidth)
    - opt to bandwidth of output link
4. **propagation** delay in the link: time = length / speed
    - opt to the amount of data
5. => end-end delay: the number of **hop** * L/R 

## loss

: Packet Loss Rate (<-> Packet Delivery Rate)

* usually in router
* in a buffer when queueing delay, data > queue capacity => dropped
* host: re-transmission, network: waste of resource, user: delay

## throughput

: sum of traffic in unit time

* rate = bits / time unit
1. instantaneous: throughput at the peak
2. average: throughput on the average
